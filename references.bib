@misc{CastroFernandez.2016,
 abstract = {Democratisation of data means that more people than ever are involved in the data analysis process. This is beneficial---it brings domain-specific knowledge from broad fields---but data scientists do not have adequate tools to write algorithms and execute them at scale. Processing models of current data-parallel processing systems, designed for scalability and fault tolerance, are stateless. Stateless processing facilitates capturing parallelisation opportunities and hides fault tolerance. However, data scientists want to write stateful programs---with explicit state that they can update, such as matrices in machine learning algorithms---and are used to imperative-style languages. These programs struggle to execute with high-performance in stateless data-parallel systems. Representing state explicitly makes data-parallel processing at scale challenging. To achieve scalability, state must be distributed and coordinated across machines. In the event of failures, state must be recovered to provide correct results. We introduce stateful data-parallel processing that addresses the previous challenges by: (i) representing state as a first-class citizen so that a system can manipulate it; (ii) introducing two distributed mutable state abstractions for scalability; and (iii) an integrated approach to scale out and fault tolerance that recovers large state---spanning the memory of multiple machines. To support imperative-style programs a static analysis tool analyses Java programs that manipulate state and translates them to a representation that can execute on SEEP, an implementation of a stateful data-parallel processing model. SEEP is evaluated with stateful Big Data applications and shows comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art stateless systems.},

@article{Chowdhury.2019,
 abstract = {Heart attack is one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. Every year, about 610,000 people die of heart attack in the United States alone-that is one in every four deaths-but there are well understood early symptoms of heart attack that could be used to greatly help in saving many lives and minimizing damages by detecting and reporting at an early stage. On the other hand, every year, about 2.35 million people get injured or disabled from road accidents. Unexpectedly, many of these fatal accidents happen due to the heart attack of drivers that leads to the loss of control of the vehicle. The current work proposes the development of a wearable system for real-time detection and warning of heart attacks in drivers, which could be enormously helpful in reducing road accidents. The system consists of two subsystems that communicate wirelessly using Bluetooth technology, namely, a wearable sensor subsystem and an intelligent heart attack detection and warning subsystem. The sensor subsystem records the electrical activity of the heart from the chest area to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) trace and send that to the other portable decision-making subsystem where the symptoms of heart attack are detected. We evaluated the performance of dry electrodes and different electrode configurations and measured overall power consumption of the system. Linear classification and several machine algorithms were trained and tested for real-time application. It was observed that the linear classification algorithm was not able to detect heart attack in noisy data, whereas the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with polynomial kernel with extended time-frequency features using extended modified B-distribution (EMBD) showed highest accuracy and was able to detect 97.4{\%} and 96.3{\%} of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), respectively. The proposed system can therefore help in reducing the loss of lives from the growing number of road accidents all over the world.},

@misc{Ding.15012015,
 abstract = {A cloud-based data stream management system (DSMS) handles fast data by utilizing the massively parallel processing capabilities of the underlying platform. An important property of such a DSMS is elasticity, meaning that nodes can be dynamically added to or removed from an application to match the latter's workload, which may fluctuate in an unpredictable manner. For an application involving stateful operations such as aggregates, the addition / removal of nodes necessitates the migration of operator states. Although the importance of migration has been recognized in existing systems, two key problems remain largely neglected, namely how to migrate and what to migrate, i.e., the migration mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead and result delay during migration, and the selection of the optimal task assignment that minimizes migration costs. Consequently, migration in current systems typically incurs a high spike in result delay caused by expensive synchronization barriers and suboptimal task assignments. Motivated by this, we present the first comprehensive study on efficient operator states migration, and propose designs and algorithms that enable live, progressive, and optimized migrations. Extensive experiments using real data justify our performance claims.},

@article{Feng.2011,
 abstract = {Stateful stream process engines in high availability clusters (HACs) track a large number of concurrent flow states and replicate them to backups to provide reliable functionality. Under high traffic loads, existing solutions in such HACs are expensive owing to precise stateful replication. This work presents two novel methods to address this issue: randomization on replication representation and a replication scheme designed for when system becomes overloaded. A hashing structure called Multilevel Counting Bloom Filter (MLCBF) is proposed as a low resource-consuming solution of stateful replication. Its performance and tradeoffs are then evaluated based on theoretic analysis and extensive trace-based tests. Trace-based simulation reveals that MLCBF reduces network and memory requirements of replication typically by over 90 percent for URL categorization. Most importantly, MLCBF is quite as simple and practical for implementation and maintenance. Moreover, an adaptive scheme called dynamic lazy insertion is designed to prevent replication from overloading system continuously and optimize the throughput of HAC. Testbed evaluation demonstrates its feasibility and effectiveness in an overloaded HAC.},

 abstract = {Factory (87) Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Builder (97) Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. Factory Method (107) Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses de-cide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. Prototype (117) Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. Singleton (127) Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. Structural Patterns Adapter (139) Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompat-ible interfaces. Bridge (151) Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Composite (163) Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierar-chies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Decorator (175) Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Facade (185) Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. Flyweight (195) Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects effi-ciently. Proxy (207) Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.},

 abstract = {Serverless computing offers the potential to program the cloud in an autoscaling, pay-as-you go manner. In this paper we address critical gaps in first-generation serverless computing, which place its autoscaling potential at odds with dominant trends in modern computing: notably data-centric and distributed computing, but also open source and custom hardware. Put together, these gaps make current serverless offerings a bad fit for cloud innovation and particularly bad for data systems innovation. In addition to pinpointing some of the main shortfalls of current serverless architectures, we raise a set of challenges we believe must be met to unlock the radical potential that the cloud---with its exabytes of storage and millions of cores---should offer to innovative developers.},

@article{Puliafito.2019,
 abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) is essential for the implementation of applications and services that require the ability to sense the surrounding environment through sensors and modify it through actuators. However, IoT devices usually have limited computing capabilities and hence are not always sufficient to directly host resource-intensive services. Fog computing, which extends and complements the cloud, can support the IoT with computing resources and services that are deployed close to where data are sensed and actions need to be performed. Virtualisation is an essential feature in the cloud as in the fog, and containers have been recently getting much popularity to encapsulate fog services. Besides, container migration among fog nodes may enable several emerging use cases in different IoT domains (e.g., smart transportation, smart industry). In this paper, we first report container migration use cases in the fog and discuss containerisation. We then provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art migration techniques for containers, i.e., cold, pre-copy, post-copy, and hybrid migrations. The main contribution of this work is the extensive performance evaluation of these techniques that we conducted over a real fog computing testbed. The obtained results shed light on container migration within fog computing environments by clarifying, in general, which migration technique might be the most appropriate under certain network and service conditions.},

 abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms and {\textquotedbl}serverless{\textquotedbl} cloud computing are becoming increasingly popular. Current FaaS offerings are targeted at stateless functions that do minimal I/O and communication. We argue that the benefits of serverless computing can be extended to a broader range of applications and algorithms. We present the design and implementation of Cloudburst, a stateful FaaS platform that provides familiar Python programming with low-latency mutable state and communication, while maintaining the autoscaling benefits of serverless computing. Cloudburst accomplishes this by leveraging Anna, an autoscaling key-value store, for state sharing and overlay routing combined with mutable caches co-located with function executors for data locality. Performant cache consistency emerges as a key challenge in this architecture. To this end, Cloudburst provides a combination of lattice-encapsulated state and new definitions and protocols for distributed session consistency. Empirical results on benchmarks and diverse applications show that Cloudburst makes stateful functions practical, reducing the state-management overheads of current FaaS platforms by orders of magnitude while also improving the state of the art in serverless consistency.},

@inproceedings{Wiener.2019,
 abstract = {Newly arising IoT-driven use cases often require low-latency anaiytics to derive time-sensitive actions, where a centralized cloud approach is not applicable. An emerging computing paradigm, referred to as fog computing, shifts the focus away from the central cloud by offloading specific computational parts of analytical stream processing pipelines (SPP) towards the edge of the network, thus leveraging existing resources close to where data is generated. However, in scenarios of mobile edge nodes, the inherent context changes need to be incorporated in the underlying fog cluster management, thus accounting for the dynamics by relocating certain processing elements of these SPP. This paper presents our initial work on a conceptual architecture for context-aware and dynamic management of SPP in the fog. We provide preliminary results, showing the general feasibility of relocating processing elements according to changes in the geolocation.},

abstract = {Applications that require real-time processing of high-volume data steams are pushing the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include market feed processing and electronic trading on Wall Street, network and infrastructure monitoring, fraud detection, and command and control in military environments. Furthermore, as the "sea change" caused by cheap micro-sensor technology takes hold, we expect to see everything of material significance on the planet get "sensor-tagged" and report its state or location in real time. This sensorization of the real world will lead to a "green field" of novel monitoring and control applications with high-volume and low-latency processing requirements.Recently, several technologies have emerged---including off-the-shelf stream processing engines---specifically to address the challenges of processing high-volume, real-time data without requiring the use of custom code. At the same time, some existing software technologies, such as main memory DBMSs and rule engines, are also being "repurposed" by marketing departments to address these applications.In this paper, we outline eight requirements that a system software should meet to excel at a variety of real-time stream processing applications. Our goal is to provide high-level guidance to information technologists so that they will know what to look for when evaluation alternative stream processing solutions. As such, this paper serves a purpose comparable to the requirements papers in relational DBMSs and on-line analytical processing. We also briefly review alternative system software technologies in the context of our requirements.The paper attempts to be vendor neutral, so no specific commercial products are mentioned.},
